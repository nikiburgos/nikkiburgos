### Hi there GitHub community! 👋🏻

I'm Nikki, a passionate Full Stack Web Developer with a focus on Front End and UX/UI design. 
I have experience in teamwork, customer service, computer tools, and social media.

😄I consider myself hardworking, responsible, and self-taught, always looking to learn more and improve my skills. I'm also a precise and organized person, which allows me to achieve my goals effectively and efficiently. I value collaboration and assertive communication, I am practical, perceptive, and highly responsible, which helps me work well both in teams and on individual projects.

🌱 Currently, I'm finishing the "SoyHENRY" boot camp, which has given me more than 800 hours of practice in web programming. I've been learning technologies such as:
JavaScript | HTML | CSS | React | Redux | Node | Express | SQL | PostgreSQL | Sequelize | Git | Scrum | Figma | Photoshop 

⚡ Fun fact: I also studied Law at the National University of Cuyo, which provided me with valuable skills such as dedication, perseverance, assertive and effective communication, and the ability to learn constantly; skills that are essential in the world of web programming.

I must mention that in my downtime, I enjoy practicing yoga 🧘🏻‍♀️ and spending time with my cat🐈, who is my faithful companion during my long programming sessions.
